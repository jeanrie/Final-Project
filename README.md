# Final Project

## Deep Learning-Based Energy Disaggregation and Time-Series Analysis for Optimizing Household Appliance Use

I am an enthusiastic Computer Engineering Student specializing in Data Science at Technological Institute of the Philippines.


## About Me 🎶

I'm constantly exploring new technologies, much like Taylor Swift explores different musical genres.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new programming languages and frameworks:
  - 📊 Advance Machine Learning
  - 🧠 Deep Learning
  - 💫 Quantum Computing
  - 💻 Computer Network
- 🎸 Fun fact: I often find inspiration for my code while listening to Taylor Swift's music. It's like magic!
